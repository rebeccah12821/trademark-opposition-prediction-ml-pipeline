## Overview

This project develops a machine learning pipeline using real USPTO data to predict the outcomes of trademark opposition cases. It provides actionable insights for IP portfolio management and enforcement strategies by analyzing key factors influencing opposition success.

## Key Findings

- **Trademark age** is the most influential factor in predicting opposition outcomes, surpassing all other legal and factual features.
- **Stylized marks aged 40–50 years** achieve the highest opposition success rate (86%), highlighting a cumulative advantage for distinctive, visually unique brands.
- **Young word marks (0–10 years)** are least likely to succeed (36%), emphasizing the importance of both mark type and longevity.
- Success rates increase with age for all mark types, with stylized and figurative marks benefiting most.

## Features & Methods

- **Feature Engineering:** Trademark age, detailed mark types, opposition grounds (e.g., likelihood of confusion), non-use claims, industry class.
- **Modeling:** Ensemble models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
- **Visualization:** Advanced data visualization to interpret feature importance and multidimensional interactions.

## Results

- **Predictive Accuracy:** Achieved 59.6% accuracy in predicting opposition outcomes.
- **Model Explainability:** Trademark age dominates feature importance.
- **Nuanced Patterns:** Stylized marks aged 40–50 years have the highest success rates; young word marks fare worst.
